# Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset on the air quality in a central location in Dar er Salaam, Tanzania. The data is recorded by sensors that measures the level of partiuclate matter in the air that are less than 2.5microns. The dataset consist of time series data with over 50,000 data points recorded over a period of 3 months and the goal is to develop predictive model with a mean absolute error below 1.5  

Note: Plotly graphs do not render in the project notebook (dar_er_salaam_air_quality.ipynb) because github does not render embedded html in notebook.
